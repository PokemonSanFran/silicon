# Adventure Guide
While exploring the world, press {START_BUTTON} to use your phone. Your phone is used to look at your Pokémon, use an item from the Bag, or Save the progress you've made on your adventure.
Check out the {COLOR_RED} Adventure Guide {COLOR_BLACK} whenever you want to review handy tips like these that you receive along your adventure!

# Pokédex **
Battle or catch Pokémon to compile volumes in your Pokédex app—with fancier covers for Pokémon you've caught. Open up your Pokédex to view all the volumes you've collected on a digital shelf and check out what rewards you can earn by pressing the X Button!
Press the + Button when looking at a Pokémon you've registered in your Pokédex, and you can check that Pokémon's habitat to learn more about where they can be found and when they're active. Explore different areas as you adventure, and meet tons of Pokémon!

# Pokémon Boxes **
You can keep six Pokémon in your party at once. Any other Pokémon can be sent to your Pokémon Boxes for safekeeping.
From the main menu, you can select your Boxes to open them up. From there, choose Pokémon to swap in and out of your current team.
You can use the Pokémon Box Link to access your Pokémon Boxes while you're on the road. You'll be able to add Pokémon to your party or transfer Pokémon from your party to a Box.
You can access your Boxes by selecting Pokémon from the X menu and then pressing the R button.

# Catching Pokemon **
You can try to catch a wild Pokémon you are battling by pressing the X Button and throwing a Poké Ball.
When you're having a hard time catching a Pokémon, try to deal damage to it before throwing another Poké Ball. That should give you a better chance of success!

# Battling against Wild Pokémon  **
The Pokémon you see wandering around in tall grass, caves, and elsewhere are wild Pokémon. When you run into a wild Pokémon, a Pokémon battle will begin!
You can also start a battle by looking toward a wild Pokémon and throwing one of your Poké Balls at it by using the ZR Button! Try this tactic out to battle Pokémon that are up in trees or flying in the sky!

# Remembering Moves  **
If Pokémon skip learning moves or forget old moves, they can learn them again! Open the main menu, select a Pokémon, then select Check summary. On the status screen, go to the Moves and Stats tab to check your Pokémon's moves and help it remember some!

# When You're Feeling Lost **
When you don't know where to go next, you can ask for help at any Pokémon Center. The staff there can give you tips about where you might want to try. Plus, they'll register their suggested destinations on your Rotom Phone for you.

# Surprise Trades **
With a Surprise Trade, you don't choose who you'll trade with or what you'll get. Just choose a Pokémon you're willing to part with from your Boxes, and your trade will be carried out automatically. You'll need an internet connection to use this feature.

# Fishing **
If you see shadows in the water, you'll likely find Pokémon lurking beneath them. Face such a shadow and press the A button to cast your line and try to fish up a catch! If your Fishing Rod shakes, press the A button once more to reel in a Pokémon. Try fishing wherever you spot these shadows!

# The Gym Challenge **
The Gym Challenge is an event in which aspiring Trainers travel around the Galar region to try to collect Gym Badges from eight of its Gyms. To earn a Gym Badge, you have to complete that Gym's mission and also defeat its Gym Leader.

# The Flying Taxis **
If you use the Flying Taxi service, one of their well-trained Corviknight will have you zipping across the Galar region to your desired destination in no time at all! Just open up the X menu, and use the Town Map to choose where you want to go!
