* Imelda (shock): Man, if Trainers see you backing this and people already know how strong you are... we've got a shot at real legitimacy.  
* Player (sweat): I think you're giving me too much credit\! Believe it or not, Sharp Rise’s Kickstart program was a huge part of the reason I was able to hone my skills this much.  
* Imelda: And I can't wait to turn that power against those Sharp Rise goons. They're gonna collapse under their own weight, and then we can reinstate all the old gyms and go back to when times were good and I was running this joint\!  
* Player (confused): Is that your goal? Just go back to the past?  
* Imelda: Yeah\! Things were so much better before.  
* Player: Imelda, you can't go back to the past. You've gotta stick to the reality we've got right now. I think what you're going to do here is going to make a real difference for Trainers, and that's awesome. But if you want the Trainers of the region to be the best they can be, I think we need to figure out a path forward... in the present. That's what Kai and I want to do.  
* Imelda (angry): You don't get it, PLAYER, you weren't here before.  
* Player: I wasn't here, but I'm here now. And while I'm new, I'm really starting to love it here and I want to help Trainers, and help people, just like you do. And we can do that, moving forward.  
* Imelda: Your heart feels like it's in the right place. I gotta get back to work. Let's at least get this test off the ground.

# Summary & Notes
After Kai pitches the Gym Restoration Quests to the Player, Player visits Espulee Outskirts to speak to Imelda. Imelda likes the basis of Kai's idea, but doesn't want to move forward until Kai and Alicia have a concrete plan for dismantaling the new League. Alicia convinces Imelda that working in the now and doing some sort of harm reduction is better than doing nothing.

Imelda is okay with at least trying, and talks about her idea to help teach Trainers to deal with the hand they're given, referencing the Battle Factory, where Trainers do just that. Imelda gives the Player a Red Scale and tells them to trade up until they can come back with a Wyrdeer.

The Player must trade the Red Scale for several different items until they find somebody who will evolve a Stantler that knows Psyshield Bash. When the Player returns with a Wyrdeer, she is impressed and re-energized, and challenges the Player to a battle. Oncec the Player wins, the Quest is complete and the Espulee Gym is reborn as the Espulee Swap Meet (Battle Factory).
