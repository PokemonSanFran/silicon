# Summary and Notes

## First
CleanuppoliceA works security for Sharprise Arena and has been tasked with cleaning up the area from troublemakers and vagrants. CleanuppoliceA asks the Player to help clear the area. After talking to all the identified troublemakers, it is revealed that all four are just unhoused people, but after a battle and some conversation, all four agree to leave the area. 

If the Player is in the True Timeline, the player will take note of the fact that these are not troublemakers but in fact, just unhoused people and refuse to work with CleanuppoliceA going forward, but either way gets a Reward when all four people are gone.

## Second
CleanuppoliceA works security for Sharprise Arena and has been tasked with cleaning up the area from troublemakers and vagrants. This extends to Cureno Port, which is the town next to the Arena, and a vocal minority of the citizens have made clear their displeasure with the influx of unhoused people. CleanuppoliceA asks the Player to help clear the area. 

In the True Timeline, Player will refuse to work with CleanuppoliceA at all and thinks harassing the unhoused is cruel. 

All of the unhoused people from the last quest recognize the Player, and tell more of their story, but after but after a battle and some conversation, all four agree to leave the area. 

If the Player is in the True Timeline, the player will take note of the fact that these are not troublemakers but in fact, just unhoused people and refuse to work with CleanuppoliceA going forward, but either way gets a Reward when all four people are gone.

## Third
CleanuppoliceA works security for Sharprise Arena and has been tasked with cleaning up the area from troublemakers and vagrants. Officially, this does not extend to Glavez Hill, but CleanuppoliceA wants to stamp out these vagrants once and for all and wants to push them out of this perfectly good town. CleanuppoliceA asks the Player to help clear the area. 

In the True Timeline, Player will refuse to work with CleanuppoliceA at all and thinks harassing the unhoused is cruel.
