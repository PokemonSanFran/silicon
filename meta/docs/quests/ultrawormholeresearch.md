# Summary & Notes
Player returns to Adelaide's office and interacts with a bookshelf, which has a book about Esperanto on it. The Player recognizes the language from working with Pannen, and attemps to pick up the book, which triggers a secret staircase behind the bookshelf. Player goes down the bookcase which leads to a secret lab under the Salesforce Tower where they meet Pannen again, who has no memory of the player and is significantly older. Pannen attempts to use a new technology where Pokémon are brought from other dimensions into Resido, and asks Player to go throughout the region and capture them. In exchange, Pannen will help transport the Player to dimensions where they can battle and capture the Ultra Beasts. After unlocking all of the dimensions, Pannen gifts the Player with a Type:Null. 

The alternate dimensions are palette swapped versions of the routes where the totems are found. These dimensions have no encounters, no humans, and some of them have a puzzle on the route that must be solved before getting to the Ultra Beast. For example, if Totem Kingler unlock Buzzwole and is found on Route 1, the Buzzwole dimension is an alternate Route 1.

It is revealed over the course of the quest that Pannen and Pannenspouse both become Fallers but continued to work together (without memory of the other) under Sharprise. Repeated exposure to Ultrawormhole Energy resulted in Pannenspouse losing their sanity, and now they wander Resido, abandoned by Sharprise.
