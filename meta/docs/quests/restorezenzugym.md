# Summary & Notes

Player battles Doyle. Once the Player wins, they properly introduce themselves and explain that they believe in Kai's vision, but doesn't think its possible in Resido. Doyle says Sharp Rise and its League is already too far gone, and their talents are best when trying to create real revolutionary art and film. 

Doyle wants to take the same idea to Unova's PokéStar Studios where they think they'll be able to have a bigger impact. Alicia argues that Resido is worth investing in and fighting for, and Doyle challenges Player to prove it. Doyle will consider keeping the idea if the Player can find people in Resido with the skillset of what he needs and who think of battles in a forward, revolutionary way.

Player has to go and talk to five of the NPCs that give out "Unique Battle" quests and convince them to join Doyle's cause. This requires those quests to already be complete.
