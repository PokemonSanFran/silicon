# Summary and Notes

Arcademini is in the Popidora Arcade, and asks the Player to play Punishment Roulette with them. The game is the Battle Arcade's conceit, but the roulette only deals out punishment squares and only deals them to Arcademini, who takes great pleasure in feeling the pain. The player battles Arcademini, and when the Player wins, Arcademini expressed immense gratitude, reminiscing about their displaced community where these events were more commonplace. Arcademini reveals that the entire game was built, wired, and lit up by them. Arcademini encourages the Player to come back whenver they want.
