> Kai is standing on Arantraz, looking out at ocean like the edgelord he is. Tala approaches from the south, telling Kai that this spot is where she usually relaxes when she feels accomplished. She asks if Kai proud of the work they've done.
> 
> Kai laughs and asks if Tala is serious. Kai exclaims that the new Sharprise CEO is just another corporate suit, who might not be an outright murderer, but certainly isn't going to do anything meaningful. Tala asks if Kai expected Player beating Lucrezia to be the end of Sharprise, and the company would just quitely go away. Kai realizes that he wasn't sure what he was expecting, but hoped that they had done more.
> 
> Tala remarks that Alicia is a fantastic example of the The Tide doing more. Alicia came to the region totally in support of Sharprise, and Kai managed to redirect Alicia's talents towards actually helping and rebuilding the region - and by continuing that work, they're going to keep doing that for other Trainers.


Kai sighs and says Alicia is just one Trainer - educating people is great, but there's so much more work that could be done today. Kai then lists all the things they haven't managed to do. This is a list of all the quests that the Player hasn't finished yet.

Tala laughs and says that Kai might be right, but Kai is discounting all of the work they've done. Tala then lists all the things that they have done. This is a list of all the quests that the Player has completed.

Tala says that she and Magnus have been working at this longer than Kai has been alive, and the struggle to do "more" will always exist. Tala has realized that her and maybe the The Tide's job is inspire the next generation to keep empowering the next generation to do good.

Tala tells Kai that he can be proud of the work done so far and still recognize that there's work to be done. It might not even get done in Kai's lifetime, but its their... responsibility to plant berries that only their grandchildren will get harvest.
