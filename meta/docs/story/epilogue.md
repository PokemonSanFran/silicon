> 
> Baiya laughs and asks if Tala is serious. Baiya exclaims that the new Sharprise CEO is just another corporate suit, who might not be an outright murderer, but certainly isn't going to do anything meaningful. Tala asks if Baiya expected Player beating Lucrezia to be the end of Sharprise, and the company would just quitely go away. Baiya realizes that he wasn't sure what he was expecting, but hoped that they had done more.

> Tala remarks that Alicia is a fantastic example of the The Tide doing more. Alicia came to the region totally in support of Sharprise, and Baiya managed to redirect Alicia's talents towards actually helping and rebuilding the region - and by continuing that work, they're going to keep doing that for other Trainers.


Baiya sighs and says Alicia is just one Trainer - educating people is great, but there's so much more work that could be done today. Baiya then lists all the things they haven't managed to do. This is a list of all the quests that the Player hasn't finished yet.

Tala laughs and says that Baiya might be right, but Baiya is discounting all of the work they've done. Tala then lists all the things that they have done. This is a list of all the quests that the Player has completed.

Tala says that she and Magnus have been working at this longer than Baiya has been alive, and the struggle to do "more" will always exist. Tala has realized that her and maybe the The Tide's job is inspire the next generation to keep empowering the next generation to do good.

Tala tells Baiya that he can be proud of the work done so far and still recognize that there's work to be done. It might not even get done in Baiya's lifetime, but its their... responsibility to plant berries that only their grandchildren will get harvest.

if we want to tie the hellscape of the region together
